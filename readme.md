Baby Behavior Analysis Chatbot: Product Requirements Document
1. Product Overview
The Baby Behavior Analysis Chatbot is a Telegram-based application designed to help parents understand and predict their baby's needs. Using historical data patterns of feeding, diaper changes, and crying episodes, the system analyzes and predicts the most likely reason for a baby's distress in real-time. The chatbot also serves as a memory aid by providing parents with information about past baby care events.

# NEW FEATURE: Natural Language Query

The Baby Alert bot now supports natural language queries! Parents can ask questions about their baby's activities in plain English, and the bot will provide relevant information from the database.

## Examples of Natural Language Queries

- "When was the last feeding?"
- "How long did the baby sleep today?"
- "How many diapers were changed yesterday?"
- "What's my baby's feeding schedule?"
- "When was the last diaper change?"

## Setup for Natural Language Queries

To use this feature, you need to:

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key in the environment:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

See `src/NLP_README.md` for more detailed instructions.
